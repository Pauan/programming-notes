 #
 # Because `x` does not have enough money, the transfer waits until `x` has
 # sufficient funds.
 #
 # The account `y` does have enough money, and so 10 cents is transferred to
 # `x`. `x` now has 15 cents. This causes the transfer from `x` to `y` to be
 # retried. This time `x` has enough money, so it transfers 15 cents to `y`.
 #
 # The final result is that `x` has 0 cents, and `y` has 15 cents. This
 # happens regardless of what order the transfers occur, and each transfer
 # happens atomically.
